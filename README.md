NYU-LaTeX-Dissertation-Template
===============================

A LaTeX template according to New York University's GSAS dissertation guidelines

As if writing and defending a dissertation were not difficult enough, there is one final and formidable hurdle facing all dissertators: a properly formatted submission. The directions available from the GSAS leave something to be desired, especially for those who typeset with LaTeX. In order to make the end of the road easier for beleaguered graduate students, here is a template of a properly formatted dissertation for New York University's Graduate School of Arts and Science (as of September 2012).

A few important notes about this template:
  * You'll need to know LaTeX for this to be useful.
  * I use the Unicode–aware version of LaTeX called XeLaTeX. Anyone knowing LaTeX may wish to look into XeLaTeX, which allows the use of users' local fonts. I typeset my dissertation with Linux Libertine and Junicode, though I also recommend Computer Modern Unicode.
  * This template has been tested successfully with TexLive 2012 and MacTeX 2012.
  * I used Biber with the BibLaTeX package, instead of the traditional BibTeX. This allows for much easier internationalization and customization.
  * The template uses the Memoir class, intended for the typesetting of book–length projects.
  * I have enabled character protrusion with the Microtype package. This is a newly introduced feature for the XeLaTeX system, so make sure it is working correctly.
  * Instead of Babel, XeLaTeX uses Polyglossia for multilingual hyphenation.
  * I have no intention of keeping this up–to–date. If it works for you, great. If not, then have fun hacking it.
